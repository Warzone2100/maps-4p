A tiny 4-player map!
- **Ultra low oil**: With only 2 oils in base, games on this map will be super slow-paced.
- **Tight geography:** This map is very narrow, simulating the roughness of a snowy mountain.
- **Scavengers**: There are 4 scavenger bases, each containing 1 oil.
- **Flexible Teams**: This map can be played FFA or 2v2. Teams can be top/bottom, or left/right!
